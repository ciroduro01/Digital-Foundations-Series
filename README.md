## The Mission

In a world driven by technology, digital literacy is no longer an optional skill—it is a fundamental right. **Digital Foundations** was created to bridge the gap between simply "using a computer" and truly "mastering" one.

These activities have been **tested in the classroom** and refined to be accessible, fun, and highly educational. By observing how learners interact with these tasks, the content has been polished to ensure maximum engagement.
